# MuscleHub-A-B-Testing
business analysis of gym's acquisition funnel

## Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to determine whether potential gym members were more likely to purchase a membership based on whether or not they were given an entrance fitness consultation exam with a personal trainer. In this setup, group A followed the normal acquisition funnel and completed a fitness test, whereas group B skipped this test to proceed straight to membership application.
